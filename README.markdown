# Git Scripts

A set of scripts to perform laborious git tasks.

## About

Git provides a way to merge multiple branches into a single branch, but not the other way around, which was what I needed. So, after searching for answers on the web, I came with the git-reverse-merge.sh script which does the job. To keep things organized, this repository was created to hold this one and the others that will eventually be created.

## Usage

Usage information can be found at the beggining of the respective script.
